# prismarine-boilerplate
Module BoilerPlate to help you get started.  This will need to be edited, but the tests and gulp file are fully functional as it stands.  Please look through and rename anything you need accordingly.  We like to have independant developers name their modules as such "prismarine-module-tinkers_construct".  If you have any questions, please feel free to join us on gitter or leave an issue open on https://github.com/PrismarineJS/prismarine-server/issues
